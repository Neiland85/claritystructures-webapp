## Decision Engine

A deterministic, versioned decision engine for intake routing and priority assignment.

- **Snapshot-locked V1** for long-term behavioral stability
- **Controlled V2 evolution** through explicit, bounded refinements
- **Explainability contract** with structured, reviewable decision reasons
- **Domain isolation** from UI and infrastructure concerns

Designed for legal-tech, risk triage, and compliance-driven environments where repeatability and traceability are non-negotiable.
