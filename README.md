# Clarity Structures — Webapp

Demo webapp for technical traceability and evidence structuring
in digital incidents.

## Purpose
This application demonstrates how to transform a digital incident
into a structured, explainable and defensible technical evidence pack.

It is not a product by itself, but a controlled entry point
to a tailored technical engagement.

## Principles
- Decision → Governance → Execution separation
- No opaque automation
- No legal or forensic advice
- Defensible technical deliverables
- Explicit limits and responsibilities

## Scope
This webapp is a demo.
All real work is technical, contextual and delivered case by case.

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (minimal, utility-only)
- ESLint
- SSR-first approach

## Status
Early bootstrap.
Structure and interaction flows under active development.
